   - Creates optimized routes considering all constraints

2. **Dynamic Adjustments**
   - Traffic incident detected via external API
   - System automatically recalculates affected routes
   - Customers notified of any delivery time changes

### Scenario 3: Exception Handling
1. **Delivery Issue Detection**
   - Driver reports address issue or customer unavailable
   - AI agent suggests alternative solutions
   - Automatic rescheduling with customer notification

2. **Weather Impact Management**
   - Weather API indicates severe conditions

## Technical Demonstration

### AI Agent Capabilities
```
User: "I need to deliver 5 packages in Manhattan today, what's the best route?"

AI Agent: "I'll optimize a route for your 5 Manhattan deliveries. Based on current traffic and delivery windows, here's the optimal sequence:

1. 123 Main St (9:00 AM) - Priority delivery
2. 456 Broadway (9:45 AM) - Close proximity
3. 789 5th Ave (10:30 AM) - En route to next location
4. 321 Park Ave (11:15 AM) - Business district cluster
5. 654 Lexington (12:00 PM) - Final stop

Total estimated time: 3 hours 15 minutes
Total distance: 12.3 miles
Fuel cost estimate: $8.50

Would you like me to assign this route and notify the customers?"
```
